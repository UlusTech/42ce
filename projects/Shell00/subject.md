## I. Instructions

- These exercises are carefully arranged in order of difficulty, from easiest to hardest. We will **not** consider a successfully completed harder exercise if an easier one is not perfectly functional.
- Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions on your files and directories.
- You must follow the **submission procedures** for every exercise.
- Your exercises will be checked and graded by your fellow classmates.
- Additionally, your exercises will be checked and graded by a program called **Moulinette**.
- **Moulinette** is extremely meticulous and strict in its evaluation. It is entirely automated, and there is no way to negotiate with it. To avoid unpleasant surprises, be as thorough as possible.
- Shell exercises must be executable with `/bin/sh`.
- You must **not** leave any additional files in your directory other than those specified in the assignment.
- Have a question? Ask the peer on your right. If not, try the peer on your left.
- Your reference guide is called **Google / man / the Internet / ...**
- Examine the examples carefully. They may contain details that are not explicitly mentioned in the assignment.

## II. AI Instructions

### Context

The C Piscine is intense. It's your first big challenge at 42 — a deep dive into problem-solving, autonomy, and community.

During this phase, your main objective is to build your foundation — through struggle, repetition, and especially **peer-learning** exchange.

In the AI era, shortcuts are easy to find. However, it's important to consider whether your AI usage is truly helping you grow — or simply getting in the way of developing real skills.

The Piscine is also a human experience — and for now, nothing can replace that. Not even AI.

For a more complete overview of our stance on AI — as a learning tool, as part of the ICT curriculum, and as a growing expectation in the job market — please refer to the dedicated FAQ available on the intranet.

### Main message

- Build strong foundations without shortcuts.
- Really develop tech & power skills.
- Experience real peer-learning, start learning how to learn and solve new problems.
- The learning journey is more important than the result.
- Learn about the risks associated with AI, and develop effective control practices and countermeasures to avoid common pitfalls.

### Learner rules

- You should apply reasoning to your assigned tasks, especially before turning to AI.
- You should not ask for direct answers to the AI.
- You should learn about 42 global approach on AI.

### Phase outcomes

Within this foundational phase, you will get the following outcomes:

- Get proper tech and coding foundations.
- Know why and how AI can be dangerous during this phase.

### Comments and example

- Yes, we know AI exists — and yes, it can solve your projects. But you're here to learn, not to prove that AI has learned. Don't waste your time (or ours) just to demonstrate that AI can solve the given problem.
- Learning at 42 isn't about knowing the answer — it's about developing the ability to find one. AI gives you the answer directly, but that prevents you from building your own reasoning. And reasoning takes time, effort, and involves failure. The path to success is not supposed to be easy.
- Keep in mind that during exams, AI is not available — no internet, no smartphones, etc. You'll quickly realise if you've relied too heavily on AI in your learning process.
- Peer learning exposes you to different ideas and approaches, improving your interpersonal skills and your ability to think divergently. That's far more valuable than just chatting with a bot. So don't be shy — talk, ask questions, and learn together!
- Yes, AI will be part of the curriculum — both as a learning tool and as a topic in itself. You'll even have the chance to build your own AI software. In order to learn more about our crescendo approach you'll go through in the documentation available on the intranet.

**✓ Good practice:**
> I'm stuck on a new concept. I ask someone nearby how they approached it. We talk for 10 minutes — and suddenly it clicks. I get it.

**✗ Bad practice:**
> I secretly use AI, copy some code that looks right. During peer evaluation, I can't explain anything. I fail. During the exam — no AI — I'm stuck again. I fail.

## III. Foreword

Below are the lyrics to *City Hunter*'s theme song, *"Moonlight Shadow"*:

```text
The last time ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

[Chorus]
I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven far away...
I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven one day.

Four A.M. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
A star was glowing in the silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through

[Chorus]
Far away on the other side.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
The night was heavy and the air was alive
But she couldn't find how to push through
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Far away on the other side.
```

### Milestone Achieved, Keep Going

You've completed the mandatory exercises for this project. Now, you have a choice:

- Continue with the **optional exercises** to explore more.
- Move on to your **next project**.

Both paths will introduce you to useful concepts. Consider the following before making your decision:

- Your first exam, as well as the end-of-week rush, will focus on C programming. It might therefore be useful to gain experience in this field beforehand.
- Your performance in this Piscine is evaluated on multiple factors:
  - Project completion is one aspect.
  - Overall progress through the full list of Piscine projects is another. Choose wisely to maximize your results.
- You can retry the same project in a few days or weeks until the end of the Piscine.
- Staying in sync with your peers promotes better collaboration.

## XIV. Submission and peer-evaluation

Submit your assignment to your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Make sure to double-check the filenames to ensure they are correct.

> ⚠️ You must submit **only** the files explicitly required by the project instructions.
